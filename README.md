# Otto's Stuff Repository

A collection of data tools, utilities, and projects for data engineering, analytics, and experimentation.

## üìÅ Projects

### üõí [E-commerce Data Generator](./ecommerce-data-generator/)
A comprehensive toolkit for generating realistic e-commerce datasets including:
- **Website traffic/session data** with realistic conversion patterns
- **Customer accounts database** with segmentation and behavioral data  
- **Email matching system** for customer identification across datasets
- **Asia-Pacific geographic focus**: Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore

**Features:**
- Low conversion rates (2-5%) and high cart abandonment (~70%)
- Guest checkout dominance (90%+) with account holder tracking
- Comprehensive matching analysis (15-25% match rates)
- Built with mimesis and pandas for fast, realistic data generation
